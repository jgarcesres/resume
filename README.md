# resume
This is a fun little website to showcase my resume. I built the website part of it with a couple of AI tools (bolt.new and github copilot), I'm by no means a frontend developer, though I understand enough javascript or typescript int his case, to get in a little bit of trouble. What's worth noting here is that the website gets built into a container via github actions, linted, tested and pushed to githubs registry. I then deploy the container on my homelab. On the homelab side I'm leveraging traefik a couple of other services to handle automatic dns updates, cert updates.
